    <h1>Understanding "LEARNING"</h1>
    
  <h1>No one is good at everything</h1>
  <p>Just you <span class="n">lack skills or abilities</span> at the present moment or just because you are not learning as quickly as easily you used to, <span class="n">does not mean</span> that <span class="d">you can’t learn</span>.</p>
  <p>It is all about <span class="d">fixed mindset</span> vs <span class="h">growth mindset.</span>
    Difference in outcome is not because they lack abilities but their <span class="n">belief becomes reality</span>.
    Those who believe they lack ability so can’t improve tend to fail, those who believe they can improve try harder which leads to <span class="h">growth and success</span>. 
    </p>
    <p><span class="h">Success</span> comes with ability and effort.</p>
    <p>Before putting the effort, you got to believe that the <span class="h">change is possible.</span></p>
    <p>There comes the role of access to <span class="h">Opportunities, Resources and support.</span></p>
    <p><span class="n">“Can I do it”</span> to <span class="h">“I will do it”</span> attitude by figuring out ways to do it.</p>
    <p><span class="d">Fixed mindset</span> students <span class="n">believe </span>learning should be <span class="h"></span>effortless, but when they encounter challenges and struggle, they feel <span class="d">incapable.</span> Challenge signifies lack of ability. 
      <span class="n">Too much support</span> will become potential barriers to kid’s success, <span class="n">prevents</span> from building new <span class="h">skills, autonomy, resilience and self-confidence</span>.
      </p>
      <p><span class="h">Best learning process</span> is to have <span class="h">challenges</span> that are not hard but require certain amount of <span class="h">time to solve.</span></p>
      <p><span class="h">Desirable difficulties</span> which will be rewarding and make you proud of <span class="h">having (such as Games)</span>.</p>
      <p>According to the famous cognitive psychologist <span class="n">Daniel_T._Willingham</span></p>
      <p><span class="h">We actually like to think.</span> While humans are naturally curious, the conditions have to be just right for curiosity to take hold (not too easy, not too hard). </p>
      <p>He suggests that this is because of <span class="h">the dopamine</span> released by the brain's natural <span class="h">reward system</span> whenever we solve a problem</p>
      <p>But <span class="d">the problem</span> is often, we confuse <span class="d">familiarity with understanding”</span></p>
      <p>We believe in <span class="d">cramming strategy</span> but that will <span class="d">reduces learning.</span></p>
      <p>However <span class="h">practice is fundamental part of learning.</span></p>

              In this interactive exercise, you've learned the importance of
              points, radius, and circumference in forming a circle.
            </p>
            <p>
              The radius is a line segment from the center of the circle to any
              point on its circumference. It defines the size of the circle.
            </p>
            <p>
              The circumference is the total length of the circle's boundary,
              and it's calculated as 2π times the radius. It's crucial for
              understanding the circle's dimensions and properties.
